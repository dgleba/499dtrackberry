Trakberry Updates (May 26,2015)
-------------------------------

Created 'trial1.py' on Pi. Must be run in root and will handle inputs from both GPIO14 and GPIO15.  GPIO 15 
    terminates the program.  GPIO14 takes a button push and writes the machine number '662' and the 
    Unix time to a prodrptdbtest database table  'Trial_1'
    Button presses less than 3 seconds apart will not be written to the database.
    
Changed 'urls.py' to direct the call 'test' to the module 'display' in Views 
 
Created the module 'display' in views.  This module takes an http request only.  It will open
    the 'prodrptdbtest' database and access table 'Trial_1'   It will retrieve the counts and latest time
    entered. It calculates how long it has been since the last part was run and sends this information to
    the template ' display.html'
    
Created template 'display.html'. This template will display the current production volume along with 
      the time since the last part has been run.  It will display it graphiclly and it will redirect every 2
      seconds back to the module 'display' so updated information can be obtained and then it is redirected
      back to the graphical interface.
